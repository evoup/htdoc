xhtml.js v2 - 2 April 2006
 - Changed to MIT licence to match v51 of whizzywig.js
 - Some simplifications to code for smaller file size.

v51 - 1 April 2006
 Bugs fixed:
 - syncTextarea did not attach to onsubmit if the form was not the immediate parent of the textarea
   this bug sometimes described as "Whizzywig does not save if it's in a table or div"  
 - Fallback font for Courier incorrectly specified as 'mono' : corrected to 'monospace'
 - Enter key on forms submitted whole page - Enter key now does nothing
 - 404 errors if buttonPath == '' or 'textbuttons'
 - Width calc now uses 'ex' rather than 'em' - better in Firefox
 - simplified code to switch designmode on + oWhizzy renamed to oW
 New Features:
 - *Extendable*: Can now add your own button or selects to the toolbar. 
   Will insert HTML or execute javascript (which may be internal or external to whizzywig)
 - Switched to MIT licence (allows use of whizzywig in commercial projects)
 - Added buttons to insert 'http://' or 'mailto:' in link form 
 - Setting color no longer inserts font tag
 - cleanUp() has a better go at removing XML inserted by Office applications
 - gentleClean switch: set gentleClean = false and spans, inline styles and classes
   removed by cleanUp(). Default is true; i.e. they are retained (unless class=Mso...),
   so not as vicious as v50
 - syncTextarea() now called whenever cleanUp() is executed

v50 - 1 February 2006
 Bugs fixed:
 - minor bugs on cleanup and insHTML.  
 New Features:
 - cleanUp() removes spans, inline styles and classes as well as fonts and table widths
   ie vicious with text pasted in from Office applications, but preserves bold, italics, bullets etc.
   This will stomp over some formatting (e.g. text color) applied by whizzywig, so you can disable
   with 
   gentleClean = true; 
 - No longer forces a white background - picks up background from the cssFile
 - Highlight button enabled for Mozilla/FireFox
 - Now uses real <button>s for tighter code
 - If a button image is missing, it will use (translated) text instead of reporting a broken image. 
   Note, this will generate harmless 404 errors in log files.
 - No longer necessary to have onsubmit="syncTextarea()", whizzywig will automatically attach the event. 
   Note, if you want process the textarea with your own onsubmit event, you must call syncTextarea() first. 

v49 - 23 December 2005
 Bugs fixed:
 - In IE, Insert Image/Table sometimes inserts at the beginning of the page instead of at the cursor.
 - When using the xhtml option, view source does not convert to xhtml
v48 - 13 December 2005
 New Features:
 - Firefox/Mozilla only: 
    Ctrl+L opens Link dialog, Ctrl+M opens Image dialog
 - Bold command always inserts <strong>, Italic command always inserts <em>
   -this means IE users can unformat changes made by Firefox users and vice versa
   -also <B> and <I> are deprecated tags
 - URL fields no longer pre-populated with 'http://' (confusing if inserting relative link)
 - 'Choose style' select has option 'Computer code' to insert <code> tag
 - cleanup() leaves spans and classes except 'mso...'
 - cleanup() substitutes long dash with '-'
 - Clicking the Cleanup button with text selected removes formatting from the selection

 - class="MsoNormal" not alway removed by cleanup();
 - IE displays a warning message if it encounters an iframe with no src attribute while using HTTPS
 - Mozilla Javascript console reports some CSS errors on whizzywig

v47 - 12 October 2005
 New Feature:
 - Clean up now takes width attributes out of tables and <TD>
   (so tables pasted in from Word will have liquid layout)
   Note: you can automatically invoke clean up on Submit with
   <form onsubmit="cleanUp(); syncTextarea();" ...
 - Cleanup has a go at removing MS xml in spans
   (typically introduced if pasting in a Word document with an image)
 - Clean up of MS "smart quotes" reverts to replacing with " and '
   because HTML entities cause problems with spell checking, don&#39;t they?

 - Whizzywig version text now hidden in a '.'

v45 - 24 May 2005

   output rather than HTML4. [Whizzywig checks for get_xhtml() function].
 - Empty tags are removed from the generated code.
 - Toolbar selects are lined up more neatly.
 - Clicking the "Clean" button with text selected removes formatting from the selected text.
   (As before, clicking Clean with no selection removes unwanted formatting on everything) 
 - Clean now removes full justification (justify renders badly in some browsers).
 - Clean turns "smartquotes" inserted by MS Word etc. into correct HTML entities.
 - Insert image border and margin fields have tooltip - can now be 
    numbers (e.g. '0', '1')  or 
    CSS values (e.g. 'thin dashed #999999', '1px solid black') 
 Bugs fixed:
 - Inserting an image or table in IE without first clicking in the edit area
   incorrectly inserted the image or table at the top of the page.
 - Clearing a link did not work on Mozilla/Firefox.
