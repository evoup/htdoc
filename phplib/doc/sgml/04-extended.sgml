<sect>Extended functionality
<p>

The section on extended functionality covers non-GUI classes
that provide often needed application functions without a user
interface. Some extended classes depend on core functionality,
some contain independent classes.

Extended classes are treated differently from core classes in
that their code is not automatically included by
<tt/prepend.php3/. You have to include the class definition
manually where needed or you modify <tt/prepend.php3/.
